# Text2Slide - Automated Slide Video Generator with Manim

Text2Slide is a Python tool that converts a simple text file with slide titles and content into an animated video presentation using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/).
For now the generated slides are very simple and there is no customization but it will come.

---

## Features

- Parses a plain text file structured with slide titles and content.
- Automatically generates a Manim scene from the slides.
- Supports rendering videos at multiple quality levels:  
  - `-ql`: Low (480p, 15 FPS)  
  - `-qm`: Medium (720p, 30 FPS)  
  - `-qh`: High (1080p, 60 FPS)  
  - `-qp`: 2K (1440p, 60 FPS)  
  - `-qk`: 4K (2160p, 60 FPS)
- Outputs the final video in a dedicated `output/` folder.
- Cleans up temporary files after rendering.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py input.txt <quality> <output_filename>
````

* `input.txt`: Path to the input text file with slide data.
* `<quality>`: Render quality flag. Choose one of `-ql`, `-qm`, `-qh`, `-qp`, or `-qk`.
* `<output_filename>`: Desired name for the output video file (without extension).

Example:

```bash
python main.py input.txt -qm my_presentation
```

## Input File Format

Please see the provided `example.txt` file for a sample input and syntax details.

The input text file should follow this structure:

```
Slide 1: Title of Slide One
Content line 1
Content line 2

Slide 2: Title of Slide Two
More content here
```

* Each slide starts with a line beginning with `Slide X:`.
* Subsequent lines until the next `Slide` header are considered the slide content.

## Notes

* The script handles input validation for quality flags and output filename.
* The rendered video is saved as `output/<output_filename>.mp4`.
* Temporary files created during rendering are removed automatically.
* The `manim_files/` directory contains Manim's internal rendering cache and intermediate files and is ignored in version control.
