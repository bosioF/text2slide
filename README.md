# Text2Slide - Animated Slideshow Generator with Manim

Text2Slide is a Python tool that converts a simple text file with slide titles and content into an animated video presentation using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/).  
For now, the generated slides are basic, and there is no major customization other than text color, but it will come.

---

## Features

- Parses a plain text file structured with slide titles and content.  
- Automatically generates a Manim scene from the slides.  
- Supports rendering videos at multiple quality levels:  
  - `-ql`: Low (480p, 15 FPS)  
  - `-qm`: Medium (720p, 30 FPS)  
  - `-qh`: High (1080p, 60 FPS)  
  - `-qp`: 2K (1440p, 60 FPS)  
  - `-qk`: 4K (2160p, 60 FPS)  
- Supports various text colors (see `--help`).  
- Optionally, add an MP3 audio track as background music.  
- Outputs the final video in a dedicated `output/` folder.  
- Cleans up temporary files after rendering.

## Usage

```bash
python src/main.py input.txt <quality> <output_filename> [audio.mp3]
# or
python src/main.py --help
```

### Arguments

- `input.txt`: Path to the input text file with slide data.
- `<quality>`: Render quality flag. Choose one of `-ql`, `-qm`, `-qh`, `-qp`, or `-qk`.
- `<output_filename>`: Desired name for the output video file (without extension).
- `[audio.mp3]` *(optional)*: Path to an MP3 file to use as background music.
- `--help`: Show usage and supported options.

### Examples

Without audio:
```bash
python src/main.py input.txt -qm my_presentation
```

With audio:
```bash
python src/main.py input.txt -qm my_presentation assets/music.mp3
```

## Input File Format

Please see the provided `input_example.txt` file for a sample input and syntax details.

The input text file should follow this structure:

```
Slide 1: Title of Slide One
Content line 1
Content line 2

Slide 2: Title of Slide Two
More content here
```

- Each slide starts with a line beginning with `Slide X:` (where X is any number).
- Following lines until the next slide, header is treated as content.

## Project Structure

```
/.gitignore
/input_example.txt
/README.md
/requirements.txt
src/main.py
/output/
manim_files/ (generated by Manim, ignored by git)
```

## Notes

- The script validates quality flags, file names, and color options.
- The rendered video is saved as `output/<output_filename>.mp4`.
- If an MP3 is provided, it is added as background audio using MoviePy.
- Temporary files created during rendering are automatically cleaned up.
- `manim_files/` contains Manim's intermediate rendering files and is ignored in version control.
